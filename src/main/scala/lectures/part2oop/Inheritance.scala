  // call the parents implementation of a method or field

  // preventing overrides
  // 1 - use final on the member
  // 2 - use final on the entire class (prevent the extension of a class (base types are final in Scala))
  // 3 - use sealed on the class (allow to extend the class in this file but prevent extensions in other files)
